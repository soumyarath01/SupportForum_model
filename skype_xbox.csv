"So, i updated my skype to the newer version, i used to have the 11. something and now i have 12.1815, i still cant hear my friends in skype, only they can hear me, i've had this problem for some time now and it is annoying me, as i cant talk to my friends on skype at all on xbox."
"Hello, this might seem trivial, but with the most current versions of Skype and system software on the Xbox One, I am unable to answer incoming calls. Upon receiving a call, I am prompted to hold the Xbox button to answer it. When I do so, instead of answering the call, the ""Systems"" tab is shown. To my understanding, answering audio and video calls is pretty much THE basic funtion of Skype, so how come that it's not working? Is this a known bug? Any suggestions to fix this issue? Thanks, Robert"
I recently bought a Kinect so I could make Skype calls on my Xbox One but the Microsoft Store only says “Skype is not availble at this time”. What does this mean? Is the Skype app retired on Xbox One? Is there any way I can use the app on my Xbox One?
"Hello, I've recently been experiencing an issue with skype calls not working. I used to be able to be in a skype call with friends while playing games on xbox one. However recently whenever I answer the call and switch from the skype app to the game my friends and I are playing, the audio cuts out and I cannot hear anyone, nor can they hear me even though I am still in the call. If I switch back over to the skype app the audio will come back. Its as if I no longer can be in skype calls outside of the skype app. Which is weird because I used to be able to play games while the app ran in the background. Any help?"

"Hi everyone, I have searched high and low and can't believe this issue could only be affecting us. Everything used to be fine until i believe sometime last year when the Skype client on windows 10 possibly was updated. (just a guess). It used to work perfectly. Now, it is unbearable. Nothing has changed on our network sides. In fact I've checked and rechecked and tried different configurations just in case and nothing works. Both clients are up to date. Once the Skype call starts, every 2 minutes or so the incoming video from windows 10 laptop to the Xbox one freezes. And stays frozen for minutes on end and eventually will unfreeze. We could force it to unfreeze by having the windows 10 user to click on the share screen button twice or just their video button. And then a minute later the same loop begins and so on and so on for the whole call. Networks are simple on both sides, modems to routers and it used to work perfectly so nothing has changed there. But just in case, i have tried the following: Full network hard power reboot/cycle of all devices.2.4ghz and 5ghzFull factory resetsFull uninstall and reinstall of Skype* The user with windows 10 has NO issues with freezing when calling anyone else on windows or if i use my laptop or phone. (no other xbox to test with)Different wireless channels and all other advance settings. (hard wire not possible)UPNP and DMZ still same issueI'm sure i'm forgetting tons of other things I've already tried Looking for a response by someone who has experienced this or has some knowledge of how to fix this @#$% annoying issue. Thanks"
