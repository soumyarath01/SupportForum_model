"At Skype, we are constantly improving our products for better functionality and this requires that we drop support for certain versions from time to time. We released Skype for Windows10 v11.8.190.0 in September 2016 as a preview version. We have since released many improvements and fixes culminating in the release of Skype for Windows10 v12.4.676.0 in September 2017. Our latest iteration v12.1813.286.0 released in April 2018, has introduced a lot more features and enhancements. Learn more. You may have received notification that we are now retiring the earlier v11.x versions so we can continue to focus on quality and improving your Skype experience. If you have Microsoft Store updates enabled, chances are you don't need to do anything as you will most likely be running the latest version of your much loved Skype. What should I do? Check whether you are running Skype for Windows10 v11.x.If you are, then you need to update Skype. We recommend that you take a backup of your chat history before you do that.Update Skype. You can enable auto-updates to ensure you are always on the latest version. Please note that you may need to upgrade to Windows Anniversary Update or higher before you can update to latest Skype version. What happens if I don't update? From May 25th, 2018 you will be signed out automatically and you will only be able to sign in after you update Skype. This affects only Skype for Windows10 v11.x The Skype Team."

Hi I am using skype in windows 10 on my Microsoft surface Pro. I need to obtain details of my original chat conversations from about 1 year ago. I would like to print these out but I dont seem to be able to find a way to do this. I have tried using Free Skype Viewer but the default location does not contain the .db file. Can you please advise how I can download these chats. Thank you in advance for your help.

"Ver. 12.1815.209.0 I have installed the Skype App from the Windows store for Windows 10. Works fine, just. In Windows 10. Skype is not listed as a App that you can turn on notifications for. Why is this ?, it's a Microsoft product right? The Skype Topic, have really poor choices, my problem is not listed & there is no other topic to chose."
"Good morning, Since yesterday I can't perform any calls to landlines and mobiles. Subscribtion is valid. I have tried to unistall and download again with no results. Need help to resolve this. Thank you."
I am using the latest version of Skype on Windows 10. I have had multiple people say they have added my Skype account but cant seem to see anywhere where they have added me therefore not being able to connect with them. Does anyone know how my issue can be resolved or am I missing something? Thanks for your time
"SKYPE -- Your browser is currently set to block cookies. You need to allow cookies to use this service. This is the most ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING error message. First, it didn't give me a clue how to go about fixing it, it, so I wasted time searching to find out that it is the BROWSER, NOT THE PROGRAM that controls. Really?!? So I wasted time again checking cookies on the browser I use for Skype. Again it didn't work. ARRGHH! What's wrong with just telling us how to fix the problem, if you're going to give us an error message? So I searched the web again only to find that it applies to IE. Really?!? When every time I start IE it tells me I should be using Edge? But OK, fine, I'll fix it in IE. I check IE. I do have some particularly obnoxious specific sites set to block, and have for years, whereas this problem only started recently. But I have ensured that both Microsoft.com and Skype.com are set to always ALLOW. Still no dice. So I went to the advanced tab and set First Party Cookies to Always Allow, Third Party Cookies to always Allow, and Session Cookies to always allow. Still no dice. So what's the problem? I'm tired of guessing games. MS programmers may think they're fun, but I don't. Would someone please just TELL us!!! DL"

"I have had my webcam disabled since buying my laptop a couple years ago, and this new skype update keeps turning the thing on, no matter how many times i remove it in my control panel settings. Call me paranoid but I REALLY dont want to accidentally knock a video call button when I'm just out of the shower or something and flash my junk at one of my friends. So basically I either need to find a way to permanently disable my webcam (an issue i have not had before this stupid update) or I abandon skype. Any advice?"
I call my number to check for voice mails but when it asks for passcode the dial screen disappaerars and I can't enter it. How does one check messages by calling voice mail number on skype?
I'm Very new to Skype and the person I have a skype meeting with asked for my ID? What ID? And what number do they call to reach me through computer.
"Skype (the newest version) drains my battery even when plugged in. When having a conversation on Skype my battery gets low and then the laptop turns off. It happens when I have a Skype video-call only, and it has never happened while using another program. I didn't have such an issue with the previous version of Skype. If I sign out of Skype, the battery life gets back to normal, and doesn't drain while plugged in. Could you please advice?"
Could anyone tell me how on the new version when making a video call can actually type the conversation instead of speaking. I have managed to kind of do this but the chat disappears under the video call and means parts of the conversation are missed. This occurs even more when I have to split screen whilst i'm on games etc. due to the screen size being smaller. Also if I try it when the screen is full size I seem to get the typed conversation coming over the actual video image which is rather annoying. All I want to be able to do is see the other person on cam and type to each other so as to not annoy other people with them having to listen to the conversation out loud. Any help would be appreciated please

"I'm using Skype 12.1803.279.0 (a huge step backwards from the previous version). I can't seem to find an easy way to print the conversations. It looks like I have to copy one line at a time.

"I recently started using the Skype app in Windows 10 instead of the program, but the notification settings seem very limited. I only have the option of notifications appearing at the bottom right of my screen or no indication at all.

"Hello, I am not able to answer calls on the Skype application on my desktop (phone app works fine). The only notification I get is a missed call, while the person calling gets a message that I am not online, when I certainly am. Moreover, this happens when I sign in with my microsoft account as well (my main account was created through Skype, without creating a microsoft account). I did a simple uninstall and reinstall of skype, but the problem persists still. - I downloaded the application from the microsoft store (since when I downloaded the .exe file from Skype's website, I could not launch it and instead was getting a message to go to the microsoft store). I have a Windows 10 desktop. Your help is appreciated, Maria"

"Hi Firstly I have never used Skype and at present have no need to. I uninstalled Skype using Windows uninstaller some time ago, it is no longer listed in my programmes but Bitdefender AV vulnerability keeps telling me to update to latest version. It appears there are still remnants of Skype on my PC. I still have the App on my PC, I am not very Tech savvy and don't really understand the difference between the programme and the App, the App I think is up to date. I use neither and in addition I understand Skype is part of Office 365 and is integrated into outlook.com and synced with my Microsoft account. I noticed a list of 'chats' phone numbers when I clicked on the Skype icon in my outlook .com email page. I am slightly baffled as I have never used Skype. Some of the numbers I recognise some not. I presume this has something to with my Windows phone being synced with my PC. I would prefer to remove Skype programme,app and all from my PC as I don't use it but apparently this is not as straightforward as I thought. I just don't feel comfortable having Skype as I don't really understand it, as I don't use it, but am concerned about any security/privacy issues with having the App etc. I would appreciate any advice ? Do I just need to reinstall the latest version and learn to live with it, is that the simplest solution ? In addition I use uBlock Origin and have been getting constant blocks every couple of seconds from something called https://browser.pipe.aria.microsoft.com/Collector. Does anyone know what this is and why I am getting this constant stream of contacts ? Is it anything to do with Skype or just a normal Microsoft process that uBlock is blocking ? Again any advice, explanation appreciated."

PROBLEM: Can't easily select and then copy-and-paste multiple text messages in skype chat. In previous versions of skype this capability was available and worked perfectly. SUGGESTION: Please return the ability to select and copy chat messages. It's way too useful and helps while working with multiple teams and multiple chats. Thank you!
"In previous versions of skype it was possible to search by people names (or substrings within people names) of recent group chats. I mean chats with no special titles. Imagine a case: a chat between 2+ people, messages contains useful info (like decisions, or links to documents, and so on). When I need some that info and trying to search for that chat by a name of either person I remember participated in that conversation - i see only my personal chats with them, but not group chats. Honestly, that's awful because I finally feel like important information is lost in those chats which can't now be found. Suggestions: restore the functionality of searching across recent chats containing multiple people as participants. Thank you!"
"DEAR MICROSOFT, UNTIL SUCH A TIME AS AND WHEN YOU CAN MINIMISE SKYPE FOR WINDOWS 10 TO TRAY, COUNT ME OUT!"
"I've used some screen recording software to record Skype video calls, but I was very dissatisfied with the recording quality and resolution of the screen recording software. For example, when I minimize or adjust the Skype call window, the video recording displays minimized or the video becomes blurred. This is a great disturbance because I didn't want to miss any part of the conversation. Is there a Skype recorder software that can record high-quality video directly from Skype for Windows 10? Thanks."

"I used to search random people in Skype for prospecting of my VA Services, but after the last update of Skype when I went into searching it came up with contacts with mutual friends. This is something cool now, mutual contacts of our business contacts in Skype?? Really! Think when you have prospect who have someone in mutual list whom you are already providing services too. It feel really good and a positive start by Skype. Hats Off to Skype :) I feel happy to rate Skype a 5 Star. Feel free to share your thoughts"

This app and offer simply doesn't work! false advertising & fake offer! I don't think I would ever trust using the Skype app again the service has gone from bad to worse since Microsoft took over.
"This is a little tip that came out of what was originally a question on my part that I never saw the answer to anywhere, but found the answer to myself and so thought I should post here for the benefit of everyone else who may have experienced the same problem. But before we get into the technical part of it all, please allow me to vent my frustration--which is very relevant, I assure you, to the subject at hand. The new Skype I personally find absolutely horrible because of it being anything but user friendly. Everything is so deeply buried it's almost impossible to dig out, rather than having it all readily accessible through a menu of simple buttons, or other such. I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel that nowadays style has started being the main focus in such a way that usability has almost become entirely lost in designing software/apps and the utilization. And I would personally take a semi-boring looking design that is completely user friendly any day of the week over something ""cool-looking"" that you have no idea what to do with. Someone reeeeeeeally needs to do some re-designing on Skype! Bring it back to the good old days where everything worked just fine and it was super-easy to navigate. Anyway, the problem I was having--which many others also seem to have had--is that of being able to find and accept contact requests; and when you try googling this, all you get is advice that doesn't work. The info about the ""Recent"" section which is supposed to appear above one's contacts, this was a no go for me as there was no ""Recent"" section. Also, Skype's advice on adding contacts simply by ""clicking the add contact button"" doesn't really do much good either, seeing as there is no such button. Alright, now after this little rant, and after some of you perhaps nodding in agreement as you have been having the same issue, let's get to how I finally figure out a ""work-around"": 1. You need to have the Skype username or the email address the person who is trying to contact you has connected with his/her Skype account. 2. Click on the ""Contacts"" button at the top left side of the screen (right next to the little bell) which will open the contacts list. 3. In the search field of that little box, type said email address or Skype username and the user should show up. 4. Click on the user and you should reach a message/chat screen with a notification that this individual wants to contact you and whether or not you will accept. 5. Click ""Accept"" and all should be good to go. NOTE: While there is a significant amount of difference between Skype on a PC and Skype on an iPhone, for example, there is a chance that you may work some things out better on your smart phone or tablet than on the PC. In this case, if you can't get it to work on your computer, try doing all of the above on your smart phone or tablet and then all will be fine afterwards on your Skype account on any piece of hardware on which you use the software/app. I hope this was of some help. :)"
"PS3 Eye not working Win 10 , plz help .."
"We have all heard about the new Terms of Service update that bans offensive language and nudity, among other things. I agree its a good thing to help crack down on the number of pornbots and scammers who have used Skype to hoodwink people into giving up credit card numbers. Not to mention Xbox Live is a haven for trolls, griefers, and general scumbags of all sorts. However, there is one major concern I have: I am in an intimate long distance relationship with my girlfriend of four years, and we use Skype as a substitute for distance preventing physically being together. Under the new TOS, we would be forbidden from using it for... adult purposes, which is basically us substituting physical intimacy for the next best thing. By forbidding all nudity and offensive language, it could potentially affect real long distance relationships between consenting adults, as well as married couples who are separated by distance, say for business reasons. I am sure there are some users who Skype with their spouses overseas on business at night in hotels. It could even affect the esteemed and honorable members of the Armed Forces, who are often sent overseas on assignments long-term, or even called to serve their country in combat against the enemy! A heavy handed automatic ban system for nudity in these cases could be extremely detrimental to the relationship. In long-distance relationships and even marriages separated by long distanceIn the absolute worst case it could lead to breakups or even divorces. And in the particular case of our great Armed Forces, having a Skype account banned for a sexy call could devastate the morale of the soldier in question; in combat situations, morale can sometimes be the difference between making it back alive...and not making it back at all. While I agree that a TOS update is necessary to combat both pornbots, scammers and of course the ever-present XBOX Live trolls, I implore Microsoft to take nudity case by case, especially in the examples outlined above. For the sake of preserving the sanctity of marriages, and of the stability of relationships, and of course to the safety of our Armed Forces and their loved ones."
"There are many feedbaks about it and questions in the forum, but I wonder, why no skype developer has ever answered about the topic. How is it possible that in three years since the release of Skype for Windows 10 has not been resolved something trivial but at the same time so important in the workplace?In one of my many feedbaks i've tried to summarize the situation:1) create or download a png image with transparent background 2) send the image to a Skype contact 3) the receiver will get the image without the trasparent background, instead he will see the image with white or black bacground. 4a) send the image from Skype UWP Windows 10 to a Skype contact with Skype UWP Windows 10 loses transparency 4b) send the image from Skype UWP Windows 10 to a Skype contact with Skype desktop classic (not UWP) loses transparency 4c) send the image from Skype UWP Windows 10 to a Skype contact with Skype desktop Mac Os loses transparency 4d) send the image from Skype desktop classic (not UWP) to a Skype contact with Skype desktop classic (not UWP) maintains transparency 4e) send the image from Skype desktop classic (not UWP) to a Skype contact with Skype desktop Mac Os maintains transparency 4f) send the image from Skype desktop classic (not UWP) to a Skype contact with Skype UWP Windows 10 loses transparency 5) misbehavior tested with multiple Skype contacts, different OS and different machines.Can someone please tell us if the problem will be fixed or no one is working on it? Plese, do not remain silent.Thank you"
"The latest Skype version seems to have lost the ability to paste a phone number with embedded spaces or hyphens into the DialPad. Please bring the old behavior back because users frequently copy and paste formatted phone numbers. Also, consider making access to the dialpad more direct. Currently, it requires one extra click to get to it."
"Can anyone provide one rational reason why as a Skype user they would prefer the skype desktop to be dominated by every call made over past several years rather than a display of the address book? Whichever Goose made this design decision needs to spend time in the real world. Sure I can down load the old Classic Skype every am when I start work but despite my attempts to switch off auto upgrades, I am still welcomed by the same piece of useless garbage when I boot up. Do we have to start a revolutio to get someone to listen at the Microsoft playschool. Any solutions would be gratefully accepted. Thanks"
"Since Microsoft decided to close the original ticket on the issue (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_win10-skype_messms-skype_instamessms/how-do-i-stop-skype-from-changing-my-online-status/ffeb56f4-aa66-42d7-b876-d6aff941f8c4?messageId=59928572-6893-4e74-8f71-ff57f25315a5) I figured I will open a new one. I went ahead and downgraded both of my PCs to use the version 7, recommended in the above post, and it indeed correct my away status from updating randomly back to active. Microsoft, please put this same functionality into your new version, it should have never been removed in the first place!"
