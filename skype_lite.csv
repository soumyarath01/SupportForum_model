"Hello there, I used to use Skype and Skype Preview on my Android device. It was pretty laggy at certain times, thus I decided to give Skype Lite a go. I really like it, but there's one issue that bothers me. In Skype and Skype Preview, I could have the chat windows in landscape. But in Skype Lite, the app only stays in the landscape mode as long as I don't open a conversation. As soon as I do so, the app just switches to portrait mode, which is really annoying, since I use the physical QWERTY keyboard to type. My question is, is there any way to use Skype Lite in the landscape mode? Thanks."

"Hello, I have a problem. I was wondering if Skype has a way to recover my old messages, since Carrier providers are able to do it. I need to recover old messages for security purposes. Thank you."
I believe at some point I went to my site bsing the secure address https: and pasted that address into skype. Now when I sent someone a link of www.cbdalley.com it shows the link without the prefix but the prefix is https:// if I type the http:// manually it works but if I just type the www.etc.com it adds https unseen. if I copy the link and paste to a notepad I see the whole thinf I thought it was my browser history so I cleard that and still have the problem. Please help john
"Following URIs are available with skype: skype:echo123?chat skype:echo123?call where echo123 is any contact name or phone number. With regular version of skype both of them are working (i.e. invoking ""chat"" will open a chat conversation with that person, invoking ""call"" will cause skype to start calling to that person). With Skype Lite ""chat"" opens chat as expected, but ""call"" does nothing."

"I tried to add my Skype account from my desktop Mac to my iPhone 7 and my iPad, but apparently I now have separate accounts. How do I get rid of teh extra accounts and meld my iPhone and iPad to my Mac Skype account? I created the other two accounts using the same password and email I used for my Mac account."
"I just downloaded Skype onto my Chromebook, and now I can make calls, but can't receive them. I do get a message that I have missed a call. Despite several conversations, my screen still says I have had no conversations. I apparently have three Skype accounts (I have always had trouble with Skype) and I wonder if that is causing the problem. Regardless, I have an interview coming up and I would really like to fix this."
"I have share my Office account as I have 5 package, and now my old Skype account has the new shared login email for opening the app. On the profile alias, I still have my old email address. one. The supposedly new email address has everything in there all my contact past calls profile picture etc. The old login now works but there are not contacts, not money and is different from the old How did this happened? Not sure what to do, last time for a Alias mistake Microsoft has deleted my 10 years account. And of-course there is no chat and no call availability to get some help from it. How would I be able to change the login emails as before? Alex"
"First there was a problem with my password and I was given words to prove I wasn't a robot that I couldn't read because they were printed as some kind of art instead of alphabets. Then I tried the audio and couldn't understand what they were saying. Bottom line I always knew my password but kept getting told it wasn't mine, even after I changed it to one the ""computer"" wanted. I then switched to another email address with the ""new"" password created that I did not want, and still cannot log onto anything that looks like SKYPE and I still don't how to use it and cannot log into my account to get started when months ago I put in my billing info completed all the questions and was still locked out of my account. There is no way to speak with a live person and I really do need to SKYPE in order to do interviews. The first time I tried, I was literally on the computer TRYING to get the right password for HOURS, maybe even all day, then I came back the next day and the message said I had made too many attempts; I had them send me a code via text and the message said that wasn't the number that was sent to me. This is quite insane. Today was the last straw, opening a NEW account with a NEW email address and still, I cannot log into my account or get started SKYPING. Mind you, this has been going on for two months now, with NOBODY at SKYPE to help."
"Hey all, Looks like my app's unread messages status are not synchronised with my Mac app's unread messages. If I go some hours without using the mobile app, and just use the Mac one, when I go back to the android app, it displays a lot of unread messages which I read on the Mac application. Does this happens to you? I'm using Skype for Mac -> Skype version 8.17.0.2 For android -> Skype lite 2805/1.39.76.30156 Thanks in advance!"
The only caveat to using skype classic as a fallback is the oversized icon the sit center bottom for translated conversations. Why is it so intrusive? The recordable area of the window is reduced by about 25% in order not to include it in the video capture. Is there a way to hide this?

"I was using skype lite along with Jiosecurity (rebranded Norton Internet Security) on my Android phone, Now Norton is warning me that skype lite is sending my Call log and device info to Facebook Inc. Now personally I hate facebook and it is disturbing to know microsoft is sharing our basic details which isn't even connected with their product(skype lite lists all the calls made through phone, skype & SMS es together) with Facebook which sells our info for huge money. This is a matter of huge concern to me and I want a clarification from Microsoft."
"Hi, Why is Skype lite push to extent in India that skype regular is unsearchable? Why cant I download regular Skype? xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Here are the reasons : 1. it wants to replace my SMS App and Dialer and for every phone number i need to make a choice wheather I pick skype to dial or regular carrier? it is regular carrier 100% times skype to skpe call is - contacts who have skype ids.this is how the most people i know in India relied on skype and they want to make the same inconvinient? I dont understand the reasoning. 4. The SMS feature is no good. REOS SMS app serves the feature much much better than skype. 5. it does not give a audible tone for DIAL Tones there is no feedback. 6. Bluetooth headset is not supported. - the biggest gripe. 7. contacts book is now recent call history default. without a tab for addressbook - how do i fined a contact, use search xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

"Now 2 days ago I updated to Windows 10 Creator's Update, and everything is all fine and dandy but there's one problem: the built-in Skype closes when I start it. Now when I look in the task manager, it is running, and my friend called me and the corner UI popped up and I could even talk to him, but when I try to open the Skype window itself, it simply sits on the blue loading screen for 5 seconds and closes itself. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling (deleting registry keys, program data and appdata for Skype as well) but nothing works. It just sits on a loading screen. Hopefully this will be fixed and a new update and my question may be completely redundant, but I would like to get this fixed since I don't feel like installing a separate program for Skype."
