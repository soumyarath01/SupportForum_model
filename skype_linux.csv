"Hi, I am using Skype for Linux 8.12.76.2 and using default PulseAudio. The problem is, no matter where I call i.e. Echo test or anyone on my contact list, Skype to Skype call is breaking, breaking really really bad. The last version was crackling sound but after this upgrade, it is impossible to hear anything at all. The Echo test sounds like this: ""He... Ska... Ple... ............tuk......tick..........

"Am I the only one who is experiencing a weird system tray icon in xfce? With the previous skype version (8.x, latest version until today), I had a small skype icon, which I could live with, but it was still annoying. Now with the latest version, 8.20.76.1, this small icon started repeating. It's even more annoying than before.

"Skype for Linux, 8.22.0.2 Is there a way to change the font Skype for Linux uses for messaging and interface? The default font doesn't support some common (for me, your expirience might be different) characters like ꍫ and ꍡ. My understanding is that there is no official way to do so, but maybe there are some nasty workarounds that might work?",
"Skype for Linux, 8.22.0.2. The spell checker is coupled to the interface language. If my profile language is, for example, set to English, all words written in Latin script are checked according to the English spelling rules (with no possibility to adjust it or turn it off, which is very annoying because I type in English and German more or less equally often). If my interface language is in Russian, Latin script is ignored by the spell checker, but every word written in Cyrillic script is checked for whether it is correct Russian (which it often isn't because I type in Russian and Ukrainian equally often). If I switch my profile language to, say, Japanese or Greek, neither words written in Latin script nor words written in Cyrillic script are checked, which is totally acceptable -- but then my Skype interface is in Japanese or Greek (which is impractical because I don't understand those languages well enough). Dear community, what can I do (other than learning some Japanese)?",

"Hello, After the upgrade of Skype to version 8.22.0.2 I can no longer make calls, even to Echo service. I always get an error ""Your connection is too weak. Please try again later"". Obviously, there is absolutely nothing wrong with my Internet connection. It is exactly the same as before and it is very fast (12MBps in / 700KBps out) All other Internet services (http, ssh, icmp etc) to all nodes on my home network are absolutely fine (about 30 nodes, including not only Linux workstations, but routers, switches, Android and other devices --- all kinds of operating systems). Checking the ""About"" box says ""You're on the latest version of Skype"". Using the browser version of Skype with Chrome outgoing calls work fine, so it is only the standalone client that is showing the problem. But using the browser version is very inconvenient. Please let me know when you have fixed this critical bug in the Linux version of Skype. Thank you. Kind regards, Tigran",

"Having just updated to the latest preview version (8.22.76.6) I couldn't help but finally notice some sense being put into the user interface: the chat list view now has a ""compact"" option, even though almost hidden as it's under the sorting filter drop down menu; nice and, most crucially - always visible, tabbing allows easy switch between list of chats, list of calls, list of contacts, and notifications; filters: the calls list can now be filtered by Skype calls or Phone calls; likewise, the contacts list can now be filtered by Skype contacts and Active Now contacts; The above may seem like small steps but make a huge difference in usability and if you value your screen real estate. So for the first time in 2 years since an abysmal and hardly functional version replaced the good old v4.3, I'd actually like to thank the team for introducing these changes. There are still plenty of UI issues to be polished but things finally seem to be heading in the right direction.",

"The minimum window size for Microsoft versions of Skype has been a problem here on an X201, 12"" screen for some time and often reported on the forum & via the feedback link. Another new version of Linux Skype, another new bug... Just upgraded to version 8.20.76.8, and now cannot access the box to add text to chat messages because that box is covered by the applications bar at the base of the screen, with too many applications listed for it to be usable at the side of the screen. Another unusable version of Skype, Microsoft has been 'developing' Skype for Linux now for about 3 1/2 years, and there is still a very very long way to go before the app is as stable, well resourced, and as user friendly as the now retired Linux Skype 4.3! Well done Microsoft, looks as though Skype will be joining the long list of once great apps wrecked by Microsoft in the very near future (or is it already on the list now?): from another thread: ""I cannot for the life of me understand what it is about Microsoft.... You buy up successful companies, and then ""improve the user experience"" to the point where the end result is unusable and loathed by most users. Worse, you keep doing it, and not learning from mistakes. You bought Multimap in the UK and changed it to Bing Maps.... every update made it worse than it was. You bought Nokia, and installed Windows on their phones, and destroyed their business in the process. You changed Hotmail into Outlook, and the latest Windows version is so slow and unresponsive it is verging on unuseable. You bought Skype, and keep tampering... it wasn't broken, so there was no need to fix it. The latest update on Android is by far the worst software I have ever used On my Samsung Galaxy S5, you have turned using the keyboard into a horrid experience. The characters typed lag behind significantly, and the vibrate that goes with a key down lags too. I didn't ask for messages from another to be coloured blue with white type...and all the other idiot ideas you have included. There is an old adage, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". Microsoft should stop tampering with things... a bad reputation is often made worse, and I'm getting fed up to the back teeth of it."" To which we should at least add the debacle of the Zune player & Windows phone within Microsoft’s own portfolio. I must also add a note about a revision to the profile page, contributions are now listed by thread, so the link takes you to the thread where you can face up to 50 pages of answers to search through to find the post you are looking for... Another example of Microsoft's UI design policy, a relevant comparison to Macs a while ago that obviously still applies! Mac UI requires very simple skills to do great technical things with a Mac Windows UI requires great technical skills to do very simple things with Windows Hence about 1% of all jobs around the world are to help people find out how to use Windows.",
"There is a very annoying auto-stylising problem in Skype for Linux 5 where using tilde (~) will cause a portion of text to appear with in a strike-through style. This is a good idea but interferes heavily when using tilde as shorthand for ""c.a."", ""around"", ""roughly"", etc. For example: ""Let's talk about numbers. Numbers up to ~10 are easy to work with and do simple math on your fingers but once you reach ~100k it suddenly becomes difficult"" The above message will cause the entire text from 10 to 100k inclusive to appear in strike-through style when this clearly was not the intent of the message. In fact, there is no way to have two tilde characters in a message without having this side effect irrespective of how and where they are placed. Shorthand tags like this for stylising are useful but should be implemented with caution.",

"On the most recent version of Skype for Linux (8.16.0.4-1), if I leave the audio speaker settings at ""Default"" device, the audio is terrible -- it keeps cutting in and out. I do use PulseAudio, and the Alsa playback/record streams are showing up in my PulseAudio volume control. However, interestingly, the output and input streams in PulseAudio volume control are flashing in and out at high frequency, almost as if Skype is opening and closing the stream continuously. Interestingly, if I set a specific device in Audio Settings for the speaker, then this problem disappears. Hopefully this helps someone. Regards, Raman",

"Hello everyone, I know this has been discussed in the past, but since the change of the Skype support website there's no way to vote on that old discussion, so I decided to create this discussion to bring this subject back to life. Linux has lots of different of desktop environments and I can understand way why Microsoft decided to better support GNOME, but I believe that they shouldn't just support one DE. GNOME is the default DE of the most popular distros and therefore, by supporting it, most users are covered but do you really believe that that KDE community is small or not worth the extra effort for a little support? It's really a pity using only GNOME Keyring and not KWallet. Why not both? What about native notifications in KDE? Is it really that hard to implement those? I don't think so, what do you think?",

"Well for this last three weeks, I have not been able to receive VOIP calls in Skype 4.3, even though MS claimed the product was going to be retired 01 July. Now I cannot make Skype to Skype calls anymore either. The only functionality I have left is outgoing VOIP calls, contact management, and partial Skype Chat. To reiterate, incoming calls (VOIP or not) do not function. Outgoing Skype-Skype calls do not function. Chats work, with an additional error on the other end that states I am using an old version of Skype, and the chat make not work. I think someone jumped the gun by a day or two.",
"I just got a new Skype update on Linux Mint (Ubuntu), (Version 8.15.04) and I thought maybe Microsoft finally solved their WebCam issues. I have a Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 - which even seems to be an officially supported camera. Hello Microsoft. The issues with the webcams not being discovered/supported can be found already on many websites. Why don't you just garb a Logitech cam and a Linux computer to try it out yourself + fix your Skype. If this is not going to be solved soon...I might finally remove Skype from my computer forever. Really frustrated about the obvious inability behind MS's software development.",
"I am currently using 8.11.0.4 because newer versions do not find my webcam (HD PRO C90) despite it's being on the supported list.

I had the same problem with a slightly newer version which is no longer available in the archive. The ""bad connection"" has no effect on video or outgoing audio. My connection is 10/100. I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit Memory 32 GB Intel Core i7-5930K CPU @ 2.50Ghz x 12 Geforce GTX 980 I can only conclude that the problem lies with Skypeforlinux.

"Hi Guys, Maybe no point to ask, but I do it anyway. Why is there no screen sharing for SKYPE on Linux? I can watch other people sharing their screens without any problem, but I can't find a way to share my screen. Is this is in the plan or no chance at all? Thanks a lot, Ralf",
"Hi, I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 amd64 with skypeforlinux 8.16.0.4. Skype seems to correctly identify the webcam as ""HP 2.0MP High Definition Webcam"", but the image is black. When I run some other application, e.g. vlc, the webcam works as it should when I test it (Media - Open Capture Device: Video device name = /dev/video0). I have tried different versions of skypeforlinux between 8.10.0.4 and 8.16.0.4 but the problem is the same. I have tried both the kernel 4.4.0-112-generic and 4.13.0-32-generic with same result. With the old Skype version 4.3 the webcam worked perfectly. Any idea? The webcam hardware: # lsusb -v [...] Bus 003 Device 004: ID 0bda:57a4 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. [...] iConfiguration 4 USB Camera [...] iFunction 5 HP 2.0MP High Definition Webcam [...] iInterface 5 HP 2.0MP High Definition Webcam Thanks in advance!",
"I am using Ubuntu 16.04.01 (64 bit, kernel 4.13.0-37-generic) and skypeforlinux 8.18.06 (with call 2018.11.01.10). With Phillips webcam SPC900NC I have perfect audio but no picture. With Logitech webcam Quickcam Pro 9000 I have perfect picture but mostly bad audio (distorted voice). With Skype V4.3 both webcams are working perfect (audio and picture quality). Reinstallation and using older version of skypeforlinux does not help. I have checked any combination. Also checked different PCs with different architectures. My questions are: Is there a list for skypeforlinux compatible webcams?If not: Is there a reference webcam for skypeforlinux (for ubuntu 16.04)?Do you have any further hints? Some results of my test: I assuming that skypeforlinux doesn't support YU12? SPC900NC supports only 'PWC2' and 'YU12'. But Quickcam Pro 9000 supports only 'YUYV'.

"Skype for Linux was working great for me. Then yesterday (2018-01-09) I installed the latest update (version 8.13.0.2). Now upon logging in the app is completely blank and unresponsive. I'm running Linux Mint 17 Qiana, aka Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, Trusty Tahr.",
"ust like the title says, I'm using Skype on Ubuntu 18.04 and even though I have my headphones selected in the Ubuntu System Settings (and sounds play perfectly fine through my headphones), Skype only plays sounds through the speakers. I've tried all the different options in Skype's Audio Settings - including setting the sound output to my USB Headphone device, however Skype continues to play sounds through my speakers. I've tried install Pulse Audio but still have the same issues.",
"1. With the upgrade to version 8.20.0.9 on Linux when I start up Skype the system tray icon is TINY now. It was a similar size to all other application icons previously. 2. Secondly, when I click on the system tray icon with v8.20.0.9 with left mouse button, previously (before 8.20.0.9) it would OPEN skype. Now it does NOTHING. Big step backwards. How can I download an older version to go back to something half decent?",
"I am using Skype Preview. There was a notification that I needed to update the programme, which I did, so it is now Skype 8.10.76.3, which I understand is the latest version, but the notification still is there when I start Skype. I have checked the update manager and there is nothing to update. How do I get rid of the notification?",

"I am currently using 8.11.0.4 because newer versions do not find my webcam (HD PRO C90) despite it's being on the supported list. I don't know about the newer versions but the incoming audio starts to break up after a while and there is a ""bad connection"" message. I had the same problem with a slightly newer version which is no longer available in the archive. The ""bad connection"" has no effect on video or outgoing audio. My connection is 10/100. I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit Memory 32 GB Intel Core i7-5930K CPU @ 2.50Ghz x 12 Geforce GTX 980 I can only conclude that the problem lies with Skypeforlinux. No such problem occurs when on a Windows 8.1 laptop although (quelle surprise) it does not detect the laptop webcam so I have to plug in the C90 .... I wish I could use the old 4.3 ... say what you want. It worked.",
I have latest version of skypeForLinux on 17.10 KDE Plasma. Skype logs me out each restart of the application or system. Same problem on 2 completely different work stations.,
