Dear Admin! I want to change my skype User Name ID. Kindly. Upgrade me for this issue.
"The new Skype update is terrible. However, given that I depend on Skype for quite a few things, I have no choice but to use it. (Yes, I know I can download an .apk with the older version and block updates, but I'd rather avoid that due to security reasons) There is one particular bug that pisses me off more than anything as it can cause quite some problems. When I'm in the middle of a phone call, if I receive a Skype notification, the phone call continues on loudspeaker. I then have to turn on the loudspeaker and turn it off from the phone call menu, but the loudspeaker turning itself on every time I receive a notification is a big problem for me. Is anyone else facing this issue? Does anyone have a solution?"
but they did not show up after setting up my new phone. so I had to send them a skype request but they say they don't have one because I am already on their list. How does that work?
"I have recently won a contest that was being hosted by Skype, and I would like to redeem the reward but the bot that is supposed to help me do so isnt working and I only have 24 hours, can anyone assist me?"
"I have this problem with the new updated version of Skype in my cellphone: The previous version was fine, I can hear sounds when someone was texting me, but with this recent update (version 8.22.0.2 ) I can't hear any sounds! The notification area settings doesn't seem to be quite helpful. Please let me know what to do, I use Skype for working online in a daily basis, so I need to hear when a text message is coming."
"I have a client who has requested a Skype call with our candidate to interview. This is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon (06/06/18). I sent an invitation to my candidate through my Samsung Android to his Straight Talk phone. When I tried to test call him, it will only do an audio call. How do we do a video call?"
"Why did Microsoft have to ruin skype? Sadly I changed phones....I did my best not to update but when I changed phones, this is what happened."
"Hi, I'm suddenly unable to make voice calls to a pair of regular mobile or landline numbers I call everyday. The call starts and ends immediately with a ""Missed Call"" error. I'm using Android 8.0 on a Samsung Galaxy S8 with skype app version 8.17.0.4. I have a monthly subscription with 800 free minutes to India which I'm sure I haven't exceeded. I tried using Mobile 4G as well as Wi-Fi to no success. Signed out of the app, uninstalled, signed back in, no use. I also can't send messages to the same numbers. Please advise. -Vivek."
Does anyone know how to get rid of this new bar at the bottom of the screen it is so distracting and I never use things like that anyway
Preliminary: an exasperated comment on the system for assistance: 1. I find the pages for accessing account details a terrible and user-unfriendly deadend. 2. I shouldn't have to be making an inquiry in a forum like this. 3. A company employee should be available to help me with the problem - after all I paid a subscription. 4. I regret paying for both the subscription and the phone number. Problem 1. I paid for a year's subscription and I still had to make a Skype Credit payment to access the service 2. The subscription appears on the <My Account> page 3. The subscription does NOT appear on the purchase history. 4. I paid for a 1 month number: it DOES appear on my purchase history. 5. The recent Skype Credit payment mentioned above DOES appear 6. Clearly my recent calls have been coming off a residual Skype Credit payment I made before I purchased the annual subscription. Request: 1. Is there actually any assistance from the corporation? 2. Is there any possibility of getting a solution to this problem? Cheers [he said through gritted teeth].
"I can't log into Skype on my mobile, which is set up as a skype account using the mobile number as the log in. It is stuck on the 'How old are you?' page. Neither the Next nor Cancel button does anything, and sign out doesn't do anything either. I used to have skype on my mobile, now nothing happens. Just stuck on the Date of Birth page."
"I have purchased a skype phone number and a subsciption "" unlimited to all mobile and landlines"" in the USA. When I want to send a textmessage (sms) it states that I have to purchase skype credit. Wouldn't this be taken out of the unlimited USA subscription that I already have?"
"I can't find any settings at all to change this. Is there a way, or is this a bug?"
"Hello everyone, I use a mobile Huawei MAT 10 Lite with android 7.0, I have a Skype-number that I used to receive calls on this device. My Skype version 8.22.0.2. I've got this ***very annoying bug*** many times (also got it on my old android devices) ******** Some times, when a call comes and I push the green button to answer the call, the answering/reject screen disappears while the phone still ringing and no way to get a control about the running call ! I even re-open the Skype, but nothing says that a call is going on (ringing) ! The application gave the caller my answering-machine and he/she registered a message and finished up the communication. ******** This is an annoying situation, because I would have much preferred to get the immediate call, as in many times the calling number may not be callable or not directly directed to the person who has called me. I am really awaiting for a brisk update of this bug."
Im interested in porting my skype phone # to a Cellular provide however i need a PIN #. I could not find information on how to set up a PIN. Is this possible? Thanks.
"I have been trying to cancel my subscription for few months now ,because i do not make use of the product and the services,i am just paying without using ,i already call my bank to stop payment but still Skype is still taken money out of my account ,can any one help,even i have been searching for phone numbers like customer service number could not find any please help me."
"Hi, For some time now I have been wanting to access my very first Skype account which was set up when I was working at a particular company. I have forgotten the password for the account and I no longer have access to the email address which is associated with the account. Is there any way that I can gain access to this account without needing that email address? WheneverI have tried to follow the forgotten password process, I always receive an automated negative response. Thanks"
"Hello everyone. I hope everyone must be having a good day. When I try to sign in my Skype account, it says to verify email. It shows an email which I am not familiar with. And also when I try to rename it, it says that the account has already been renamed. I can't access to my Skype account. I want to rename my primary alias but there's the error. These screenshots are the evidences in which there is a error:"
"Is something going on with presence? As usual with Skype Android (full or lite), I log off when still connected. But what's different now is that other people show me as ""Away"" permanently (well, at least until I use Skype again, when they see me as Online)--exactly like if I had never logged off and had just turned off the phone. It used to be that if I logged off, it would actually show as offline, as I actually am. And since MS stupidly removed /remotelogout from the classic desktop client, there's no way to compensate for the above deficiency."
"When I'm on a video call skype mutes all other applications, this might be ideal for some, however, for me, this is not a feature. When I receive incoming calls or texts my Skype call is put on mute and my phone only vibrates; I would like to enable the ring as I'm not always looking at my phone screen when I'm on a video call. It would also be ideal to enable priority of certain apps over Skype. I have a priority setting on my phone for VIP contacts, but Skype overrides this. I'm frequently on call at work and sometimes missing those calls or texts simply because I can't hear them gets me into trouble. Is there any way I can do this?"
"Skype responds to no incoming calls. All settings of my phone, and of skype, are specifcally set to accept all incoming calls, yet no calls come thru. My Google Duo calls work both ways, and my Google Hangouts calls work both ways. Any help much appreciated"
"Starting today, Skype for Android has stopped working with my bluetooth headset.

"My skype name is live:f54a763d0b12cb37 , but when I try to login on Android, Skype says that user does not exist. Yet, I am currently logged in with that name on desktop. Why would this be? Screenshot of desktop to prove the account exists below."
