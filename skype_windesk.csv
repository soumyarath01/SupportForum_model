When I call my Paratransit service their phone system refuses to pick up. I have tried to get persons there to explain this to me but no one there seems to know why. Calling them from my cell phone or landline ATT phone does work. Calling other phone numbers do work. I also have a Skype phone number.
"Have been trying to dial a 01325 area code in the UK using Skype, but keep getting the message ""Invalid Phone Number"". But I was able to dial the same exact number through Skype a few days ago with no problems. Tried on both my desktop and cell phone (with and without Wifi) but got same error. I have subscriptions to both landlines and mobile phones in the UK and they are both active (and I can call other UK numbers without issue). I saw some earlier posts about this issue but they didn't seem to be resolved. Anybody have any ideas as to what's going on? Thanks."
"Split from this thread. I also am having trouble. I used to always sign in to Skype with Facebook but after having this route be unsuccessful recently, I reset my password and signed in with a username and password. I also updated to the most recent version of Skype on my desktop (Wednesday, 6/6/18). My dad, who is already a contact, was online today but was showing up as offline. I showed up as offline on his end, too. Attempts to Call, Video Call, and Message (all Skype to Skype) were unsuccessful. When I tried to call him, it didn't ring on his end, and the same when he tried to call me. He also couldn't see my chat messages. He was able to send me an email invite to chat, at which point I was able to receive a Skype call from him through my web browser, but I still could not communicate with him through the Skype application on my end. I already checked to make sure that my status was not set to ""Invisible"" and it was not. Not sure what's happening but we're aiming to try and Skype the two of us and my grandmother next weekend, so I'm hoping to resolve this by then."
"We run latest Skype on a PC, Win 7 Pro, latest version. We also run Libre Office 5.4 on the PC. Whenever Skype updates, it uninstalls Libre Office completely, including the Help files too. It's as if LibO was never installed. Any idea why this happens? Other than LibO and MS Office are competitors? :-} It's very frustrating. Happens every time Skype updates. I keep a LibO Install icon on the desktop now, it happens so often. Also, is there a way to stop Skype from updating? The old version did everything we needed long ago. Thanks. Norm"
"The contact lists that I have created and added members to fail to display those members when I select that contact list. The contact list name displayed will change to the list I select, however, no names are displayed underneath that list's name. The only contact list that displays member's names correctly is ""Favorites"". How do I fix that? Please let me know. Warmly, Laura"

"Dear Service support We are having issue with skype, since we upgrade to version 8.00, whenever it need to upgrade, it request user to add administrator credential, otherwise he will not be able to connect. There any option or any configuration that we as Administrors can change, so user can continue use the current version without need to upgrade the version? Thanks José Luz"
"I use Skype messaging on my laptop - not on my phone. So there are occasions when I am not using my laptop, but I get a Skype message. Is it possible to configure Skype somehow to send a text alert to my mobile phone whenever I get a new Skype message? Thanks."
"Hi, I think Virus is activated in Skype I am getting daily friend requests from some accounts and their friends of friends and so on with the message: [5:48:23 PM] *** Здраствуйте Ali Добавьте меня пожалуйста *** If I accept the request It forwards me same URL's to click em not clicking any of them... each time I send any new message to these newly added friends get some URL's looks like some bot or spam code is activated. These looks like real person profiles. I have declined their requests many times and reported to Skype but this is not stopping anyway. What should I do now? :("
"I use Skype a lot, and it has been I.K. for a while, until the latest update on 7th January 2018. Now during a call the dialpad is useless as the audio tones are incorrect to allow normal functioning for automated selection etc. It is impossible to contact anyone at Skype, not even a robot that works I have wasted a lot of time this morning trying to find answers, any help appreciated.

"Hi, I have a problem signing in to my skype account. It's asking me for parental consent event though I'm well over the legal age limit. I am not willing to provide my credit card information, and even if I was, I do not have a US credit card number so that point is mute. I have also made another address to verify my own and it's still asking me for credit card info. My skype account is important to my job and I don't want to make another address. Please advise."
"Hi Community, I'm trying to find the difference between two versions of Skypes. I am trying to automate my update process for my company via PDQ, however, this uses Skype for Windows (7.41.0.101). I now see another entry on end users machines with version 8.23.0.10. A quick look here shows there are two versions of Skype. Can anyone explain to me the difference, please? https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12041/what-platforms-is-skype-available-on Where did Skype for Windows Desktop come from? Is it a legacy application? Are there any major differences between the two in terms of functionality? If Skype for Windows Desktop is the better application where can I download it from? Kind regards, Alix"

"After restoring Windows 10 without deleting the files, all my old message history from desktop Skype version has disappeared. I was very scared, until thankfully when I tried instead to login from the Windows 10 Skype app, all the complete message history was back again. About this my question is why it happens? How can I be able to visualize the complete message history from the Skype desktop version again? Thanks in advance."

"I have successfully made a couple of personal video calls using Skype on my desktop with plug-in webcam. However, when trying to connect to an overseas interviewer via a Skype for business link which has been emailed to me I have been unable to activate the video. Sound works fine. Any suggestions, please? Skype help tells me to log in, click on my profile picture, go to audio and video settings ad make a test call. I've tried signing in and clicking on my profile pic (I haven't actually uploaded a pic but guess that's irrelevant) but it doesn't offer me the audio and video settings. I'm compleetly baffled. I have an interview coming up in 12 hours and am very frustrated! any help would be appreciated. SE"
"Hi there community, Today after starting up the pc all of most of my skype contacts went missing. For those who were still visible in the chat history it was showing me add them in my contact list. After adding them one by one they were once again visible in the list. Unfortunately I've had many many contacts which I haven't spoken to in the last months. Is there a way to retrieve all of my contacts? I've tried accessing skype online, and the situation is the same. Kindest regards, Marjan Post transferred from Skype for Windows desktop: Instant messaging to the Skype for Windows desktop: Contacts messaging board."

"to the gentlemen who helped me delete skype from my pc tray; THANK YOU !!! i couldn't answer you individually because when i tried there was a notice above my bottom tray (yes, THAT tray) informing me the pc was awaiting Bing. i never cared for Bing, so i tweaked it off. my fault. thank you all very much for your help - it worked."
"Hey, How can I prevent sharing my contacts ""mutual contacts"" For example my family is using skype but they do have only me as contact person so they see almost all my contacts where is the privacy?"
"With skype when I go offline it shows on my friends computer as orange and available.. I set it on invisible , it shows me going offline , however I still get messages . I sign out and again it shows on another computer as orange .. I use my skype on my cell, the offline is not available only the invisible busy and available I sign out on the cell, it shows orange and available .. please explain.. Subject/title expanded by Moderator to reflect post content."
"The new Skype is terrible. Not being able to have separate chat windows, limited setting options, and I find it much slower to send messages. This version is NOT user friendly and I find it very frustrating to use and am truly disappointed. Please bring back the old version."
"Hi all, Since the outage we had last week a small number of you have told us you continue to have problems where by your online but your contacts see you as offline or you try to message someone but the message is never delivered. Our team have been working hard to identify what has caused this and we have successfully identified this issue. We are currently working on a fix and plan to test it and roll it out shortly. The chat service, which gives presence and delivers messages, is clearly a key component of the client and so we will be deploying the fix slowly to make sure it doesnt introduce any unexpect problems. I will update this thread once the chat service fix is 100% live in the mean time I would like to apologise for the continued problems."
"Folks, what is going on with this once-great communication software? I know Microsoft has a history of wrecking stuff, but this is beyond unbelievable. 1. Once you link Skype with Outlook (Hotmail), you can never un-link it, no matter how badly it operates. 2. When Skype is linked with Outlook, I get two ringtones for the same call. Very annoying. 3. When a call comes in while I'm on another call, I no longer hear the original ""call waiting"" sound, I now get another full-on ringtone, which makes it hard to carry on the current conversation. 4. When simultaneous calls are made to/from the same people (like right after a call gets disconnected and both try calling each other back at the same time), you cannot deal with the ""unwanted"" call if you answer the incoming call. In other words, if you answer a call from someone you are calling simultaneously, your call to them will still go through, and all the way to their voicemail, which will eventually start giving you loud and annoying prompts during you conversation, like ""if you are satisfied with your message, press one now"" and sometimes these go on for minutes before they ever disconnect. I have had this problem now for over a year, have reported it multiple times, so they know about it, but choose to let it continue instead of fixing the problem (which didn't even exist before they messed it up). 5. No more personalized greetings for voicemail. Just taken away by the overlords, who obviously know what's best for us. 6. Now, voice messages no longer show the time duration of the message, as they used to. Guess we don't deserve to know such things any more. 7. Tech support is making it nearly impossible to reach them now (no surprise, as who would want to field calls or chat sessions from angry Skype users who remember how great Skype used to be?). They claim you can still reach them if your browser supports pop-up windows, but I have no problem entering chat sessions on many other web sites with the several browsers I use. Only Skype is a problem on all my browsers, including Microsoft Internet Exploder. 8. All the ""updates"" of Skype don't fix any of these things, so it seems they are only there for the sole purpose of getting people to use ""Bing"" as their home page. 9. Obviously, what's really important to tech support is the censoring of a cartoon butt in the ""mooning"" emoticon. Oh, the humanity. There are still many more issues I see other users having that I expect will happen to me eventually. These things could only happen if Microsoft wanted it this way. I don't expect any support from this post or any other. I guess we'll just be relegated to enjoying the last vestiges of Skype while we can, before it has been destroyed completely and rendered unusable by its new Masters, who must have struck some deal with some major telephone provider who wants all of us Skype users to come on board. Thanks, Microsoft, you ruined another one."
"On Latest version skype have only three option to show contact status 01. Active 02. Do not disturb 03. Invisible. I'm missing too much about away. So kindly please add away option for status update. Another most bothering option on Latest version is Link Preview, when we need to share then skype automatically make thumbnail that is so big and very very ugly. I see option and there is a no option to stop it not to generate preview. So kindly stop it. we need to simple send text that is better for us. We do not need preview. I think skype should take care about these two option, it will make skype more attractive."
"I just want to post an idea I think it would be very helpful a lot of Skype users, especially Business members. Whoever thinks he can benefit of that should please raise their hands and send this feedback to request that feature! So there is my feature suggestion..... Please add the ability option to convert a message into a task! The idea is, that even I read further messages that message that I converted to a task will still cause a app-badge-number to show the count of uncompleted tasks, that way we will not forget about something I was previously messaged to get done. And also maybe have some section for Uncompleted/Completed tasks. Will really be appreciated! Thanks!"

"I have over 100 passwords. I type my information into forms constantly. Now, on being asked for my date of birth to access skype, this is too far. Yes, I can make one up. I'm at the wrong end of 50. But no, I don't want to have to remember a bogus date. So, if you insist that I have to have one, then I choose to opt out of Skype. It's nasty enough that it constantly wants to access my contacts. P*** off. Zoom is pretty amazing and works far better. So goodbye Skype."
"In addition to shutting off and disabling all the ""normal"" update switches, add a new subkey DisableVersionCheck to the registry: Go to Run > type RegEdit. Then go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > Software > Policies. Right-click on Policies then select New > Key then type ""Skype"", without quotes. Right-click on newly created Skype key then select New > Key then type ""Phone"", without quotes. Right-click on newly created Phone subkey then select New > ""DWORD (32-bit) Value"" then type ""DisableVersionCheck"", no quotes. Double-click the newly created DisableVersionCheck value and in Value data: type ""1"", no quotes. Close Registry Editor. Done!

"Can I get rid of the ""Your contacts have not been very active recently... Why not post your own status update?"" ? Its irratating, especially when I've been speaking to them less than a few hours before. So it just a bit of useless programing and as I'm supposed to interact with what appears on my screen it's really annoying me, because my reaction is ""it's none of your ******* business what my friends are doing b****** off and mind your own business"". So my immeadiate reaction to opening Skype is irratation - is this a good business modle?"
"When I get a Microsoft account, for example with a 365 plan, I register an @outlook.com address, which is the main form of online ""identity"" from then on. Cool, maybe, if Microsoft doesn't mess this up, shooting themselves in the foot (or rather the head) as they usually do, I might actually start switching over from using my @gmail.com as my online identity to the @outlook.com one. But no no... When I register for @outlook.com etc. I also get Skype, and wonderful, super-intelligent Microsoft seems to entirely ignore that most people already have a Skype account. So what do you do now as someone unfortunate enough to be a Microsoft customer??? Are you supposed to have two Skype accounts?? Do you keep the old, as a separate, while ignoring the new one using the new @outlook.com adress and the associated microsoft account, which is what microsoft is trying to force you to do??? --> What did Microsoft actually plan for customers to do in this situation???? Seriously, I don't know what you want us to do, even if we did have the patience to do that. It would be so simple to let customers link an old user name and account content to a new account. Trust me, people would quickly stop using their old username and you would have a chance of getting them to switch from gmail.com to outlook.com. Instead, microsoft once again shows it's incompetence in understanding what users actually want and how to build trust and loyalty, and instead try to trick and force people to give up old usernames and let go of old accounts, all so that they can make people replace @gmail.com identities with @outlook.com ones on their own terms. So why should I trust you as my provider then???"
"As soon as I filled out the billing information as I was asked to on skype app homepage, the very next day (ie today) I am not being able to login to the app while I can login to the desktop version. They may want now the banking info before I can use the app!! Or did I make enough free calls to Canada that the company felt that they were going to be broke. :D #lol"
The new version of Skype doesn't have an option to share contacts :( and this is an regress.
"I have notice my desktop version 7.41 does not sync well with my Skype for Iphone, for instance. If you go to the ""Recent Chats"" section I usually delete conversations I have already answer or do not need any more, when I do this they do delete from the desktop version but not the App version on the Iphone and vice versa when I use my iphone. This same issue also happens on my computers using Windows 10 Skype. Basically one has to be updating conversations in ""Recent Chats"" manually through out the various devices to be insync making it very weak compare to other chat services that do update all movements across different plataforms."
"started using google hangouts to replace skype. 1) the new version interface is TERRIBLE. are they joking? who thought this was an improvement. 2) doing basic things like bridging two calls into a conferece call makes no sense, is intuitive and unclear and most often I forget how to do it, cannot see if its working. 3) the damn thing asks for upgrades, switch to new version, classic vs old, non stop on all my machines, uninstalled it to remove the pestering 4) as a paid subscriber, there is nowhere i can see to get any support, literally none. if there is its impossible to find. 5) on my main computer, skype now immediately ends calls before it dials out, so I cannot use it. Typical Microsoft, take over a product then progressively make it worse, MUCH worse over the years. Skype version 4 and 5 was 100x the product Microsoft has now built. EMBARRASSING! skype is on a one way path to irrelevance and failure. Did you guys move your windows mobile team onto skype, so they can fail at something new?"
I usually use skype on my phone but today I tried to sign in on my computer. It asked me to use an email rather than my user name like it usually asks. When I sign in it signs me into my msn skype and not the one I'm currently using. How do I get into my account again? YuuPoteito

"Title is pretty self explanatory. I've been using Skype for ages to video call my long distance girlfriend all the time and now whenever I use it, it lowers the volume of everything I do, whether it's YouTube videos, talking in Discord (which we use instead of Skype mic), and all of my games that I play. Not only is the communications set to ""do nothing"" like everyone suggests, and how it used to work just fine for years, but now it doesn't seem to do anything and Skype calls still lower all of my volume, AND fluctuate them frequently. It's annoying and frustrating to have to readjust all of my volume mixer options constantly just because of Skype/Windows no longer working as they are intended. My girlfriend doesn't have the same issue and she is running 7.31.0.104. I was just using version 7.40.0.151, uninstalled and found a download for 7.31.0.104, and still did not have any success with the sound issue. I just now updated to the latest, 7.41.0.101, yet still have zero success with it. To test, I had a video playing in the background, called my girlfriend and just waited around 30 seconds before the video volume was lowered without fail, every single time. Please tell me there is a fix for this or that I'm not the only one?"

It's making Skype incredibly unreliable, and every single contact I have is having the exact same issue. Doesn't matter if you use desktop or phone, the issue is still there. What is going on?"

"I've been struggling to find out where is the file of my current Skype profile located in my computer. I'm using the classic version of Skype on Windows 7. I've tried searching at Users>user>AppData>Roaming>Skype>user>Pictures but it is empty. I believe that it's somewhere in my computer or if not, it's only stored online which means I can't find it in my computer. If so, how do I download it? Does anyone know where is it located? I want to find it so that I can remove my profile picture without worrying that I will lose the picture forever just in case I want to see or use it again."

"Hi all, Since the outage we had last week a small number of you have told us you continue to have problems where by your online but your contacts see you as offline or you try to message someone but the message is never delivered. Our team have been working hard to identify what has caused this and we have successfully identified this issue. We are currently working on a fix and plan to test it and roll it out shortly. The chat service, which gives presence and delivers messages, is clearly a key component of the client and so we will be deploying the fix slowly to make sure it doesnt introduce any unexpect problems. I will update this thread once the chat service fix is 100% live in the mean time I would like to apologise for the continued problems."
