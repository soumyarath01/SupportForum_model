"I use a Apogee Jam as input to Skype on Mac, but it stopped working in the past couple weeks perhaps after the latest update. The Jam works fine in GarageBand. In Audio settings on the Mac I can see the VU meter detect sound. However, when the Jam is select in Skype no sound is produced. Has Skype dropped support for USB attached CoreAudio ? I am running Skype version 8.22.02, Calling version 2018.20.01.7 on a iMac running High Sierra 10.13.4 Thanks, Jeff Watson"
Skype is stuck at sending messages.
"I have an important interview in 24 hours using Skype, but my Skype account is so old that nothing works to get me signed in. Need a live person to walk me through what to do. Anyone?"
I have two iMacs and use Skype for Mac on both of them for work. Can't access contacts on second computer. Haven't used it all winter and can't locate business contacts. Think I might be using the wrong account because I only see personal contacts. How can I change this?
"I am calling a number that has worked before and on skype and it now I get the repeated message ""call-invalid phone number"" Why is this happening? 1) Fact the number is valid 2) I tried other valid numbers in the UK but it skype described the call as ""call invalid phone number."" 3) I tried valid numbers in the US and I am not having any problems. 4) I am not sure if this is happening with other countries in Europe. 5) I am unable to reach any of my clients in the UK. 6) Once again, I have called those clients and got through to them on Skype. Please advise,"
"Hi, I am not able to add a phone number to skype contacts. I followed the instructions for OS X on the skype website but when I put the cursor over the face of a contact, no options come up. What am I doing wrong?"
"I am trying to make an overseas call to the UK, England. Every time I try, Skype says the number is invalid. I am getting the number from an official Barclays bank statement so I know the number is correct. Here is the number listed on that statement: +44 (0) 1624 616000 Now, I do not know what I'm supposed to do with that (0) entry, but here are all the numbers I've tried in Skype: +44 1624616000 +44 0 1624616000 both of these are invalid according to what Skype says. Any ideas what I need to do here?"
"Hello, I'm trying to get rid of the speakers muted alert. It appears whenever Skype cannot directly affect the volume control (on my mac its when I route the audio through HDMI or an aggregate source that combines the internal MacBook speakers with HDMI out), I get the ""speakers muted"" message. I can switch back to internal speakers and it goes away, but I won't have audio routing externally. Is there any way to get around this or is Skype just poorly designed in this regard? I'm on a MacBook Pro with Sierra OS 10.12.6 and the newest version of Skype. Thanks in advance!"
i have had 2 Skype calls where the other person can't hear me. the microphone is working on FaceTime though. i am using a Mac. this was working OK previously
"Hello I was wondering if anyone knew a way to remove any of the overlay graphics in full screen mode. I'm specifically referring to Controls for 'Stop Video' 'Mute' 'Hang Up' on the bottom.... As well as the Timer and 'Show Chat' on top. These controls all seem to go away when I am not in full screen mode, and I click away from the Skype Window....trying to do the same in Full Screen Mode. They are a bit distracting when I am sharing video through an AJA U-Tap Device. Thanks! -Marc van Osdale"
I can't find a way to have Skype automatically sign me in when I launch the program. I don't want to keep entering my Microsoft ID and password MAC OS 10.11.6 Skype version 8.22.0.2
Why does Skype tell me I'm offline when I'm not
I have wiped out all skype file and downloaded most current version - twice. And it still crashes. Not sure why but always offers to send it to Apple. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I would hate to drop Skype from our international university community. Thanks!
"If an app’s Edit menu doesn’t include a spelling or grammar command, check its preferences or menus to see if it has its own spell checker. This is what Apple tells me to do in MAC OS when I want to disable spell check for an specific app. Currently I can't find any way to do this in the mentioned version of Skype: There is no spell checking in Skype->Edit, nor in Skype->Preferences, nor by right clicking the text input box. Is there any way to disable spell check in this version of Skype for MAC?"
I need to be able to cut and paste phone numbers to skype but this feature has been disabled. Please reenable it for me.
"Problem: I call my skype number and hear ringing, but on my skype display there is no ringing and the button does not pop up to answer the call. History: I have a 3 month skype number subscription and only receive calls. It has been working fine until today. Skype is installed on a MAC. I have gone through all the re-installing, privacy setting changes, etc.----nothing."
"Split from this thread. Others tell me I'm offline/away when the Skype window is not actively being used. If I switch to a different application and work in that application for a while without switching back to Skype, it shows me as away. This started occurring with Skype version 8.10.0.4. Please advise."
"For the last several days, when I try to make a video call, it doesn't ring. I get a sound like a frog croaking. It repeats for a while and then I get a pop-up that says my contact is not available. My contact can video call me and it works perfectly. Can someone tell me why I can't call out? I can text-chat with this contact."
"When I initiated a group Skype video call, I could only see the first person I first connected to on Skype and when I added the other 2 persons on the group call, I couldn't see them on my screen but they all 3 can see each other. I used to make a group call a lot but never encountered this problem before. Thank you if anyone knows what to do."
"Hello, In video calls, Skype defaults to the other person being in an enlarged box while the local video feed of yourself is in a tiny box in the lower right corner. Clicking on my image only makes it smaller and fullscreen isn't much of an improvement. The other person turning off their camera just defaults to a large image of their icon and I'm not seeing any menu options to toggle the call view to splitscreen or something similar. Is there a way to make my own video feed bigger while on a Skype call in version 7.58? Thank you, Jen"
"I just discovered an issue with Text Messaging. According to Skype chat Tech support they are aware of it, maybe maybe not. A text message appeared from a known contact, now my fault was that I was in a hurry and did not pay attention. The text looks something like this, will not include the entire thing, starts with ""http://www.goo.gl.........ends with ""username"". If you click on the link then my entire Skype Contact list received the text. Fortunately I do not allow Skype to have access to my entire contact list! My hope is that someone might see this post and avoid the problem. I did not get the sense that Skype has or is going to send an alert to everyone that this is going on! I wish they would!"
"How do I uncheck the ""Use port 80 and 443 as alternatives""? This seems to have been a major problem setting up XAMPP and now seems to be happening with MAMP. I deleted Skype and now works, but could not see option in preferences."
"I was also update with the new Skype version. It is horrible, messy and the overview is terrible. Please go back to the old sign or have someone making some good changes so the site looks inviting and easy to use. Bernd"
It's easy to enter split screen - click on the picture in picture of your local video. But how on earth to exit to remote full screen with local PnP? You'd think that you could just click (or right-click) on the split to toggle back. But no. How about clicking on the interface between the split images - then dragging to the side... like you might a cell in Excel? No obvious remedial action and even worse - that last view remains even when you start a new call. Why doesn't it return to the default mode? Have to say that this new version of Skype is a backwards step. Pointless change for the sake of change. Bad interface design - no rollover tips for the new icons... this is basic Mac interface design... oh that's right this is Microsoft. Another feature lost is the feedback at the end of the call - to say how good the service was. Why was this removed - because the new version is so bad? Really bad GUI experience. Total fail.
"I have been using Skype daily for the past 3 years and this new one is absolute rubbish. Clearly UX was not part of the thought process here. Also, you really should ask people if they want to upgrade. I had seen it on other users' computers and was not interested in ""upgrading"" at all. 2 days later, it did it, itself. I can't view pdfs easily, some of my contacts don't receive the messages. How do I go back to the version I had? *A moderator has edited the title according to Microsoft Code of Conduct."
"New Skype is absolutely horrible. No screen sharing.No SMS.Search is useless.Old message history is gone.No way to configure most of the settings, stored history, etc.It uses Electron, a 120MB package which is based on Chrome, so: Massive memory use (439MB, which grows while idle (memory leak?), for Skype Helper, 89.5MB for Skype, so over 500MB of RAM for a chat program).Massive updates every time.Slower performance. Ugly themes.Rating screen almost EVERY time I finish a call. This is the only ""feature"" of the Old Skype I would be happy to see removed! There are many other problems with it... it's an utter mess, and a real shame. The mobile version is equally as poor, and most of the time I don't even get notified when someone messages me. I think it's time to push people to move to other platforms, as it seems the Skype Team have lost the plot completely. You don't create a ""new"" version of an app and take away half of what made the old app powerful and useful!"
"I'm using Skype for Mac. As soon as I installed Version 7.52 (597), my Skype favorites became unusable, and my Skype contacts went from 996 to 34 (!!!!!!). Fortunately, on my iPhone app I still had my full 996 contacts. It was only after I went through the process of signing up (again) for this community and finally succumbing to the dreaded merging of Microsoft and Skype accounts that my contacts showed up again on my Skype for Mac; my favorites are now completely deleted, and I'm having to set them again. I guess this is Microsoft's way of forcing Skype users to merge their Skype account with their Microsoft Live account. I used to be on Skype all day every day for work and personal use. Then Microsoft bought them, and I cried like a baby. Now all my fears are coming to pass. Microsoft, you poison everything you touch, and you're doing the same thing to our beloved Skype."
"If this message board is being monitored: please do what yahoo and apple do, give those of us who like a no-frills, no-nonsense interface the option to continue in ""classic"" view mode. I use this for business: not interested in emojis and fluff. I need to see my favorites. I need my chat history. I need the ability to have a customized greeting in voicemail. PLEASE bring these back."
"Are you one of the early SKYPE users? Before Microsoft purchased them? Have you felt that since Microsoft acquired SKYPE that it has all gone down hill? Back in the day, SKYPE biggest competition was AOL instant messenger, when Macbook Pros started becoming popular AOL IM started a 4 way video conference which was popular for a while, until SKYPE started allowing multiple video conferencing. AOL IM slowly went the same direction of My Space as the ability to call phone numbers around the world was very useful for people, especially globe trotters like me. So then Microsoft purchased SKYPE. Being a Macintosh guy, I knew this was going to wreck a great program/service. After a short period, SKYPE needed people to have a MS account, not something that I wanted or needed, but eventually the programmers at Microsoft would write confusing code to the point where you gave in and tried to associate my account with an old Hotmail.com account which caused me to send them $50.00 for talk time on an account that I never access. (Very confusing). Now again the programmers of Microsoft are changing things without even considering that no one wants their changes. If you raise your voice to complain, you are only speaking to people that hold the same anger with Microsoft. Calling customer service is a waste of time and money, two years ago I tried to call customer service, kept getting messages to call back during business hours (Funny when I called to all the call centers around the world, during all times of the day and night), and finally realized Microsoft does not care about any of the customers of SKYPE. As long as they can get subscriptions from people they can be as terrible as they want and ignore the customers. Me I am going back to the old version on my pad and phone (If possible), and plan on using a new VOIP Service when I can make that change. Seems like there are so many out there What's APP, Viber, and then some of the Chinese we are going to read everything you write apps like WeChat. Does anyone one have ideas of how to get Microsoft to listen to customers?"
"Mac 10.13.1 Skype 8.11.0.4 Am I the only one? This upgrade is for the birds. I don't have time to learn about all the messed up stuff Microsoft decided to do with this version. I'm a business user and I simply need to communicate - message. call, conference, AND easily pull up contacts from the mac contacts list, etc... All that functionality has disappeared. Who do they pay do design this crap?!!!!!!!! How do I get rid of this new Skype 8.11.0.4 abomination and downgrade to the older version that actually worked? Or, can someone suggest the best or better alternative to Skype? I'm ready to jump ship."
"I updated Skype a few days ago. I used to be able to see who was online in the basic Skype window. I could double click on a contact to open a chat in a separate Window. Now, the basic Skype window does not show who is online, I can only have a chat in that window, and most of the space is taken up by a useless Welcome message that has no X to get rid of it. This is not an update. It's a downdate. It will make me much less inclined to use Skype for chatting since I have several better options. Is this a sign that Microsoft is abandoning Skype and wants to kill it?"
"I have been thinking about leaving Apple since they warn me that if I disconnect my iCloud that all files on my computer that are also on iCloud will be deleted. I can only see this as a threat to deter me from leaving iCloud. But considering going back to Microsoft I run into Skype. Since Microsoft bought Skype all my skip contacts were deleted, only phone number remained. Then a month ago, all my phone numbers disappeared. Today when I call someone and they ask me to press '2' for English, I can press 2 all I want on the keyboard or on Skype, no effect. So I'm reminded of why I left Microsoft and the old hatred comes back. The greater hostility from regulatory authorities and the press I think may have something to do with the fact that these are people who also use Skype or iCloud, etc. They too are victimised by companies who are trying to take them prisoner and who refuse to spend money to fix constant failures, in fact who apparently spend money to destroy programs that used to work perfectly well. I am not sure there is a solution. I guess my question has to be for the CEO, who is the only one who can fix the internal sabotage of what used to be a great company: Do you use your own products? Do you enjoy the experience? Or do you have staff on hand to fix immediately any issues you encounter?"
"Hi, Since the new update beeping sounds occur every time the connection weakens. I really don't want these sounds. I don't have a problem with Skype offering this kind of warnings etc. But please don't treat us as children and give us more than 4 options in the sound-preferences so we can choose the amount of irritating sounds we want. I'm specifically leaving this comment here so you know the new update is a step back in terms of usability. The only plus I see is that it looks younger. But that's it. All I want is enough options in the settings to form Skype to my needs. Is there a way to handle the sounds in this version already? Let me know whether Skype will turn back to more usability for the clients in stead of focussing on emojis."
"I was charged for a subscription which skype tried to 2 times before to charge the day before and didn't succeed because i only wanted to use Skype once. Which i didn't even get to do. Now i am seeing an amount being charged and for the life of me i cannot get to cancel the amount or cancel a subscription that i did not choose and now i have to waste a lot of my time researching how to do this. I am so angry right now about this that i feel to go to social media about it, that i have been robbed. If you check your records i only used your chat service once for about an hour and paid approximately US$18. I would appreciate it if someone can contact me, since i can't see anywhere how to contact you. Thank you ."
"Not only can you no longer set specific tones for specific events you left us with only a volume control in setting, File transfers don't work. This used to be a great way to communicate between remote offices, I'm looking for something new."
"The new skype version is becoming more and more useless. last, albeit minor issue, is the welcome screen where you can do nothing. why not show last chat? can we turn it off? i think its time that the responsible people at microsoft publicly confess how little knowledge about software development and user interface design they have."
"new Skype is so awful. why did you take away all of the features. keyboard shortcuts: i used to be able to press cmd+shift+v to turn my video on or off, and cmd+shift+m to turn my mic on or off i used to be able to press cmd+up or cmd+down to raise/lower the volume which brings me to my next complaint: I USED TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST THE VOLUME OF SKYPE ON ITS OWN. Not linked to the system volume. Now Skype volume is tied directly to the system volume, meaning i can't adjust the background volume independently of the volume of the call! also i used to be able to resize the width of the chat window"
"What has happened to Skype? Suddenly, ! cant login, nothing works, nothing makes any sense, theres no-one to contact for help except 'the community'. What a load of crap! Is anyone having similar problems?"
How can I roll back the update?
"I was just forced to update to the newest Skype as my previous version simply stopped working. No 'Status Selection' anymore from top icon? I now do not have the option to 'select my status' from my top menu Skype icon as I used to. It now simply says, 'Open Skype', 'Sign Out' & 'Quit Skype'. Removing features and making it more difficult to use. No 'Away' Status Option? This is ridiculous to actually 'remove' a feature that people are using. I'd like to think that there was user testing behind this action and not just a Microsoft employees thought for 'cleaning things up'. * * * I'd like to recommend that you bring back the 'Away' option and/or introduce an option for creating your own. * * * NOTE: I found this page within Skype's admin area. I'm not sure if it is 'old', but it shows how user functionality is being REMOVED for no apparent reason. https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34699/what-are-the-possible-skype-statuses Very disappointing. - - - - - - - - - - - - - Discussion Topic Options I would also like to note that the post options that I was offered below are ridiculous. I had to select 'Skype'Then 'Skype for Mac'Then only had options for 'Calling', 'Getting Started' or 'Messaging'.I selected 'Getting Started' (as this concern deals with my new Skype version).Then was presented with, 'Download, Install and Upgrade', 'Sign-In' or 'Contacts'So I selected 'Download, Install and Upgrade'. ...REALLY? It's like you aren't even using your own products. None of these options would sufficiently address what my concern is. PLEASE, have your Q/A department give these product upgrades a COMPLETE run through prior to forcing them on users."

"'m using Skype to receive calls from Japan with Japanese phone number. However voicemail greeting messages for calls from Japanese phones are aways played in English even if I set the primary language as Japanese. Actually, the messages for calls from Skype phones are played in Japanese. Basically, Japanese people never leaves voice messages if they hear English greeting message. So, this is actually a serious issue when using Skype phones in Japan. Actually, this is a popular complainant in Japan and a lot of users are leaving. See the Microsoft's official support page. https://answers.microsoft.com/ I believe it's a simple mistake considering the situation that the greeting message is played in Japanese for calls from skype phones. So, it'd be really great if you can fix this defect before Japanese users leave. Thanks,"
