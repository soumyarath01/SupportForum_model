"I am using Skype for Web in MS Edge with my second Skype account. After the recent Win 10 April Update it stopped working correctly. For some reason I can't receive incoming calls. It doesn't show any notifications when there is an incoming call. It does play the notification sound though. However, when I try to answer the call by clicking the phone button in the browser, nothing happens. Neither does the cancel call button work. It seems that the whole Skype for Web interface stops responding. The only way to restore its functionality is to reload the Skype page, but it drops the call, which is not acceptable. So, any assistance will be appreciated. ps. my system information: Windows 10 Pro x64 1803 (17134.48) Microsoft Edge 42.17134.1.0",
