"Hello, I tried SkyPE on my iOS device for the first time in a couple of years, and suddenly found myself presented with a list of names I'd never been in contact with before, nor recognised in any eMail communications. My first thought was that I'd been hacked, yet, this was the very same email account that I'd been using daily till date... so what's happened ? It appears that these are ""Suggested Contacts"", yet as I don't know them, and have never contacted them.... perhaps they were SPAMers to my mail account ??? (I dont know), I really do not wish them to appear in front of those few whom I did contact over SkyPe. Unfortunately, I cant seem to get rid of them, so I'm faced with two questions: 1. How can I get rid of these suggested contacts ? 2. Has Microsoft put my own contact id in front of another person as a suggested contact - and is this is, as I suspect, a breach of Privacy Laws in numerous countries ? (UK, Europe, Asia, US). Any suggestions - other than deleting the App, which won't fix #2...."

"I can block a contact request on my windows desktop skype app but when i click on the requester's profile in iOS, I can only accept or decline. The icons that appear when I swipe left don't seem include one for blocking either. Is blocking available on iOS and, if so, where? Thanks for any help."
"Warning Exclamation Mark. A red exclamation mark icon appears as a notification in your Skype chat window if you have sent an instant message that failed to reach the intended recipient.

So that the third person can hear and speak with the person on the skype video call. If you could answer my questions that would be really great. Thanks"
"The new 8.1 iOS release from June 2017 is terrible. Skype for the iPhone was already 99% great or better---please give us the old version back! It seems as if core functionality has been removed or it's harder to use besides changing the look 'n feel from good to bad. For example, it doesn't seem possible anymore to call out to a landline or cell number or to initiate a Skype-out calls to iPhone contacts. I saw something about uploading my local contacts to your servers which is unacceptable. Your App has ALWAYS used the local iOS contacts to be able to call their physical numbers. Also, I can't figure out how to text/SMS to a cell number...the old App would clearly and easily give you a choice between Skype IM or texting."

"Hello everyone! With the new skype update that rolled out recently, I have seen many complaints addressing it. For anyone displeased with the new skype update, continue sending in your complaints. Skype has a twitter, Instagram, a feedback center, and this wonderful website to make complaints on. For anyone curious, iOS has no way to return to a previous version of skype that is also functional. (If anyone finds a way, however, please tell me.) In the meantime, keep complaining. If they don't change it soon we can boycott it as well. For anyone looking for a good alternative Skype app, Line is extremely useful and does no have the ugly interface that Skye has given us. Remember, keep complaining! Lets get out old Skype back! #newskypesucks"
"Wow - its been a few weeks now since I suffered the shock of the new version of Skype on Android, now I have also to suffer it on iPhone. I have read hundreds of 1 star reviews across google play & App Store and even more damning reviews on microsoft communities. I also see a few replies from the 'Skype Team' on communities and they all have two things in common. 1. They are all as weak and woolly as the latest update - scripted and lacking sincerity. I am sure no-one is really paying any attention. 2. They all focus on just one point - viewing which contacts are on line - yes this is annoying but you have many other issues to address too. It would be a real shame if the Skype team failed to react accordingly to save what was a working, suitable and in a lot of cases a 'lifeline' product of communication that was easy to use across several generations and platforms. I work away from home and use skype to talk to my girlfriend, my children, grandchildren and my parents too - the beauty of the old V7 was all of these generations could figure out how to work it - it was just very simple and intuitive - all that has gone now, for some new updated modern version that it seems the vast amount of existing users didn't need or want. I am a 13 year Skype user and now find myself looking for other options and that is sad. Skype always did exactly what I, and I suspect millions of other users, needed. It worked well, with only the occasional glitch. But the Skype team know that the modern user will complain but never vote with their feet and close their accounts to move somewhere else. That is exactly why they will get away with this shambolic update and lame gestures to keep people on Skype while they pretend to listen and pretend to offer fixes. Know your demographic Skype. I bet the average Skype user is over 30 and not interested in all this tosh you have now added. What you need to fix from my perspective - 1. Keep Skype contacts individual, dont share my other contacts in this platform. Also, when I dial a number in the new skype, there is no way of then saving that number to my skype contacts 2. File share option is missing to share in Skype - Oh Dear, how did you miss this? 3. Yes, I like to see my contacts status, it makes a difference as to whether I call them or IM them 4. Get rid of all this colour and style nonsense - its way too intrusive, having to swipe up to go through the options is mandatory to be able to get rid of them to continue using the product That would be a good start for me, but you, as developers, probably know better about your customer needs than your customers do right? Thats why we have this latest useless release. Please understand how powerful your tool was. I switched to android recently from iphone. when the auto update came down to the android and it was so bad, I switched back to my iphone as my default. When the iPhone updated (my mistake I might add) I looked at which phone I could roll back - The android won - and now I choose which phone to take out with me based purely on which version of YOUR app is installed - think about that for a moment Skype Team. I will look elsewhere if you dont fix it quickly - the fastest way to do that is to give us the old version back. Food for thought though - your last version was so good for me, I would happily pay an annual subscription to retain it. I hope you listen to the reviews but if you don't - I hope the users grow balls and walk away, closing their accounts as they do."
i have asked the same question several times and all i get is the same question right back. No answer!
How do i delete calls history
"seems to have disappeared as a function in the update. I use Skype a lot for work, and share screen to work e.g. on the same document with a colleague. What to do?"
"Are you familiar with this phone number I found on-line? XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Since I couldn't make international call from my iPhone recenelly, I called the number. The technician asked for my full name, DOB, phone number, e-mail address, and the issue, which made me feel uncomfortable. Do you have a secure phone number we can contact with? Thanks for your response."
I am a paying customer using Skype to call my clients many times abroad. Skype took away the ability to use my iPhone contacts to dial. Now I have to dial manually checking the number several times while dialing. That is an outrages behavior to make software less user-friendly just to force us to load up contacts. I think we paying customers should widely protest at strategies like this. I have the strong feeling since skype is with MS it constantly gets worse with every update.

"The ""suggest users with mutual contacts"" is a massive breach of privacy. I use skype on macos. As I understand it, there is a new social media feature in skype for ios that suggests the names of other skype users where there are mutual contacts. In principle, I can disable myself appearing in lists of suggestions. And in principle, the ios user ""doesn't know who that mutual contact is"". But here is the privacy breach: Suppose I am user ""A"". A new skype user ""B"" just created a new account, and I was their only contact. They immediately were given a list of names ""C"" with which they had one mutual contact. Since I am their only contact, I am the only mutual contact. So skype just revealed to my new contact a list of my other contacts. So now ""B"" can write to all the users in list ""C"" and say ""I gather you chat on Skype with users ""A"". Totally unacceptable catastrophic breach of privacy. So in addition to a button which says ""do not show me as a suggestion"" I need one which says ""do not count me in mutual contacts"". Even if all my contacts had a few hundred other contacts, so it wasn't ""immediately obvious"" who the mutual contact is, ""B"" could write to the whole of list ""C"" and say ""do we have a mutual contact who is 'A' ?""."
In the old skype you saw green if someone was online now you cant see it anymore
"I wanted to contact Skype to ask them about this but I keep getting sent to the community!!!!!!! I have an account, after updating on my phone I tried to log in again....same email address, same password and yet Skype opened up another account for me??????? How is that possible? I tried again, now I have three accounts...one on my MacBook that is the original account, and another on my mobile that is the (new) account. Thinking maybe I used a different email address as I have two, I tried again with the other email address and password, and it opened yet another account. Just to be clear, I did not click on OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT, only on LOG IN! Why would Skype open a new account if I just wanted to log-in using my details of my original account? It didn't ask for any details when opening a new account, just showed up as a new account, linking to my contact who I now have to invite again, as it will not connect to my original Skype account. Very annoyed!"
